### Objective:
Developed and applied advanced technical skills to create intelligent game-solving AI systems, combining proficiency in game development and automation.

### Project Components:

Designed and engineered complex game structures, combining both the game logic and integrated AI systems.
Pioneered the development of a sophisticated Sudoku-solving AI, utilising it as a practical platform for algorithm implementation and deep learning exploration.

### Key Achievements:

Demonstrated proficiency in object-oriented programming (OOP) through clean, compliant code, validated by testing on Sudoku.
Acquired expertise in designing scalable architectures and class structures, essential for future ambitions of building large-scale SaaS or OS.

### Technologies Utilized:

Leveraged Python and Tkinter for their accessibility, considering a transition to C++ and QT for enhanced efficiency.

### Quality Assurance and Deployment:

Ensured production quality by rigorously testing and implementing robust error handling strategies.
Maintained control over deployment processes for effective project management and seamless execution.

### Future Plans:

Intend to shift to web-based hosting to achieve higher scalability, recognizing limitations of Tkinter and QT for building complex programs compared to full stack web applications.
